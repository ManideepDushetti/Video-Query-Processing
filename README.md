# Seiden: Query Processing in Video Database Systems

## Overview
Seiden is a state-of-the-art video database system designed to enhance the speed and accuracy of video query processing. Utilizing the YOLOv5s model, this system applies innovative multi-arm bandit algorithms to efficiently manage and optimize query responses.

For more details please refer to the research paper on this project.

## Features
- **Enhanced Query Speed:** Achieves up to 6.6 times faster processing using modern Oracle models.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Direct application of Oracle models to selected video frames ensures high reliability across various queries and datasets.
- **Smart Query Handling:** Employs multi-arm bandit algorithms for dynamic query optimization.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv5s
- OpenCV
